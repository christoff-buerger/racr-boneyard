# _RACR_ boneyard: good, old bones for [_RACR_](https://github.com/christoff-buerger/racr)

[This repository](https://github.com/christoff-buerger/racr-boneyard) contains not anymore maintained, but still sophisticated examples for the metacompiler library [_RACR_](https://github.com/christoff-buerger/racr). Some may still be maintained, but superseded by better examples; some may not fit the educational niche to be part of the official examples distributed with _RACR_. Its not perfect, full of treasures and garbage: a boneyard!

All examples and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the MIT license (X11 license) which accompanies this distribution (`./license.txt`).
