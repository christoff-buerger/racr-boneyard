# _RACR_ boneyard: good, old bones for [_RACR_](https://github.com/christoff-buerger/racr)

This repository contains not anymore maintained, but still sophisticated examples for the metacompiler library [_RACR_](https://github.com/christoff-buerger/racr). Some may still be maintained, but superseded by better examples; some may not fit the educational niche to be part of the official examples distributed with _RACR_. Its not perfect, full of treasures and garbage: a boneyard!
